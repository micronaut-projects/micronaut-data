# Contributing Code or Documentation to Micronaut

Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data). This is required before any of your code or pull-requests are accepted.

## Finding Issues to Work on

If you are interested in contributing to Micronaut and are looking for issues to work on, take a look at the issues tagged with [help wanted](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22status%3A+help+wanted%22).

## JDK Setup

Micronaut Data currently requires JDK 8

## IDE Setup

Micronaut Data can be imported into IntelliJ IDEA by opening the `build.gradle` file.

## Docker Setup

Micronaut Data tests currently require docker to be installed.
 
## Running Tests

To run the tests use `./gradlew check`. 

## Building Documentation

The documentation sources are located at `src/main/docs/guide`.

To build the documentation run `./gradlew publishGuide` or `./gradlew pG` then open `build/docs/index.html`  

To also build the javadocs instead run `./gradlew docs`.

## Working on the code base

If you are working with the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, you can import the project using the Intellij Gradle Tooling ( "File / Import Project" and select the "settings.gradle" file).

To get a local development version of Micronaut Data working, first run the `publishToMavenLocal` task.

```
./gradlew pTML
```

You can then reference the version specified with `projectVersion` in `gradle.properties` in a test project's `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`. 

## Creating a pull request

Once you are satisfied with your changes:

- Commit your changes in your local branch
- Push your changes to your remote branch on GitHub
- Send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

## Checkstyle

We want to keep the code clean, following good practices about organization, javadoc and style as much as possible. 

Micronaut Data uses [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) to make sure that all the code follows those standards. The configuration file is defined in `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` and to execute the Checkstyle you
need to run:
 
```
./gradlew <module-name>:checkstyleMain
```

Before start contributing with new code it is recommended to install IntelliJ [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea) plugin and configure it to use Micronaut's checkstyle configuration file.
  
IntelliJ will mark in red the issues Checkstyle finds. For example:

![](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/raw/master/src/main/docs/resources/img/checkstyle-issue.png)

In this case, to fix the issues, we need to:

- Add one empty line before `package` in line 16
- Add the Javadoc for the constructor in line 27
- Add an space after `if` in line 34

The plugin also adds a new tab in the bottom to run checkstyle report and see all the errors and warnings. It is recommended
to run the report and fixing all the issues before submitting a pull request.
