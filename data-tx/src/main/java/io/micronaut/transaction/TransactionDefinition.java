/**
 * NOTICE: This is a fork of Spring's {@code PlatformTransactionManager} modernizing it
 * to use enums, Slf4j and decoupling from Spring.
 *
 * Interface that defines Spring-compliant transaction properties.
 * Based on the propagation behavior definitions analogous to EJB CMT attributes.
 *
 * <p>Note that isolation level and timeout settings will not get applied unless
 * an actual new transaction gets started. As only {@link Propagation#REQUIRED},
 * {@link Propagation#REQUIRES_NEW} and {@link Propagation#NESTED} can cause
 * that, it usually doesn't make sense to specify those settings in other cases.
 * Furthermore, be aware that not all transaction managers will support those
 * advanced features and thus might throw corresponding exceptions when given
 * non-default values.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #isReadOnly() read-only flag} applies to any transaction context,
 * whether backed by an actual resource transaction or operating non-transactionally
 * at the resource level. In the latter case, the flag will only apply to managed
 * resources within the application, such as a Hibernate {@code Session}.
