Micronaut Data Azure Cosmos supports some of the features of JPA implementations, including:

- <<azureCosmosRepositories, Repositories compile-time generated>> and <<projections, projection>> queries
- <<azureCosmosAttributeConverter, Attribute converters>>
- <<azureCosmosOptimisticLocking, Optimistic locking>>

Cascading and joins are not supported like in the rest of data modules. More about <<azureCosmosSpecifics, specifics>> can be seen here.

The interaction between the object layer and Azure Cosmos Db serialization/deserialization is implemented using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-serialization/1.0.x/guide[Micronaut Serialization].
