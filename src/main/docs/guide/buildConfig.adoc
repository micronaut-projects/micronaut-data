Since Micronaut Data is a build time tool, it will not work correctly unless your build is configured correctly.

There are two imporant aspects to Micronaut Data:

1. The build time annotation processors
2. The runtime APIs

The build time processor is added by adding the `micronaut-data-processor` module to your annotation processor configuration in either Gradle or Maven:

dependency:io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor[scope="annotationProcessor", version="{version}"]

==== Micronaut Data and Lombok

If you intend to use Lombok with Micronaut Data then you must place the Lombok annotation processor *before* the Micronaut processors in your build configuration since Micronaut needs to see the mutations to the AST that Lombok applies.

WARNING: Lombok plugins like the Gradle plugin `io.franzbecker.gradle-lombok` are not supported as they place the annotation processors in an incorrect order.

==== Micronaut Data Runtime Dependencies

At runtime for both Micronaut Data JPA and JDBC you as a minimum need the following:

*1)* A SQL driver for your database in your build configuration. For example for H2:

dependency:com.h2database:h2[scope="runtime]

*2)* A JDBC Connection Pool Module (Hikari, Tomcat JDBC or DBCP ) from the Micronaut SQL project. For example for Tomcat JDBC:

dependency:io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-jdbc-tomcat[scope="runtime]

*3)* A configured data source in `application.yml`. For example for H2:

[source,yaml]
----
datasources:
  default:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: ''
    schema-generate: CREATE_DROP
    dialect: H2
----

Once this is in place if you wish to use Hibernate / JPA you must include the dependency on the `micronaut-data-hibernate-jpa`:

dependency:io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-hibernate-jpa[]

And add the following configuration in `application.yml`   

[source,yaml]
----
jpa:
  default:
    entity-scan:
        packages: 'example.domain'
----    

Where `jpa.default.entity-scan.packages` references the root package where your `@Entity` classes are located.

Or if you wish to use SQL then the `micronaut-data-jdbc` module:

dependency:io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-jdbc[]
