Batch deletes can be performed in a number of ways. To delete everything (use with care!) you can use `deleteAll`:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="deleteall", indent="0"]

To delete by ID or by the value of a property you can specify a parameter that matches a property of an entity:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="deleteone", indent="0"]

Finally, you can also use the `deleteBy*` pattern (the method must start with `delete`, `remove`, `erase` or `eliminate`) and any finder expression, for example:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="deleteby", indent="0"]
