To update an entity you can once again pass the entity to the the `save` method:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="save", indent="0"]

However, generally it is more efficient to use batch updates to only update the properties that have actually changed.

There are a couple of ways to achieve batch updates. One way is to define a method that features an argument annotated with ann:data.annotation.Id[], starts with the stem `update` and returns `void`:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="update", indent="0"]

In this case the ID of the entity will be used to query and perform an update on the entity with all the remaining arguments (in this case `pages`). If an argument does not match an existing property of the entity a compilation error will occur.

Another alternative is to use `updateBy*` (the method should again return `void` or a `Number` indicating the number of records that were updated):

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="update2", indent="0"]

In this case you can use any finder expression to query on arbitrary properties and any remaining arguments that don't form part of the query expression are used for the update. Once again if one of the remaining arguments does not match an existing property of the entity a compilation error will occur.
