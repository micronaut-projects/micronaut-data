In some cases, you need to build a query programmatically and at the runtime; for that, Micronaut Data implements a subset of Jakarta Persistence Criteria API 3.0, which can be used for Micronaut Data JDBC and R2DBC features. To utilize this feature add the following dependency:

dependency:jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api[]

To implement queries that cannot be defined at the compile-time Micronaut Data introduces api:data.repository.JpaSpecificationExecutor[] repository interface that can be used to extend your repository interface:

snippet::example.PersonRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example",source="main" tags="repository",indent="0"]

Each method expects a "specification" which is a functional interface with a set of Criteria API objects intended to build a query programmatically.

Micronaut Criteria API currently implements only a subset of the API. Most of it is internally used to create queries with predicates and projections.

Currently, not supported JPA Criteria API features:

- Joins with custom `ON` expressions and typed join methods like `joinSet` etc
- Sub-queries
- Collection operations: `isMember` etc
- Custom or tuple result type
- Transformation expressions like concat, substring etc.
- Cases and functions
