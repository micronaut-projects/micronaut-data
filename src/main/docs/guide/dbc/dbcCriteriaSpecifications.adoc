Micronaut Criteria API for JDBC / R2DBC currently implements only a subset of the API.

To use Jakarta Criteria API you need to add an optional dependency:

dependency:jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api[]

Currently, not supported JPA Criteria API features:

- Joins with custom `ON` expressions
- Operators dealing with an entity type and casting
- Collection operations: `isMember` etc
- Transformation expressions like toString, substring etc.
- Cases

More information about Jakarta Persistence Criteria API 3.0 you can find at the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.0/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.0.html#a6925[official API specification]
