Jakarta Persistence Criteria API supports type-safe queries by using static metamodel that are generated at compilation time.

The metamodel generator will generate a corresponding metamodel class with an underscore suffix letter e.g. an entity `MyEntity` will have a corresponding metamodel entity generated with a name `MyEntity_` and it will be in the same package as the original entity. Every field in the newly generated entity will correspond to the entity's property and can be used as a property reference.

Example from the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.0/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.0.html#a10643[official API specification]:

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder cb = ...
CriteriaQuery<String> q = cb.createQuery(String.class);
Root<Customer> customer = q.from(Customer.class);
Join<Customer, Order> order = customer.join(Customer_.orders);
Join<Order, Item> item = order.join(Order_.lineItems);
q.select(customer.get(Customer_.name))
.where(cb.equal(item.get(Item_.product).get(Product_.productType), "printer"));
----

Note that as of this writing you cannot use Micronaut Data annotations (those found in the io.micronaut.data.annotation package) to generate static JPA metadata, the only supported way is to use Jakarta Persistence annotations (located in the `jakarta.persistence` package) in combination with Hibernate JPA Static Metamodel Generator which will generate the metamodel even if at runtime you do not actually use Hibernate, but instead use Micronaut Data JDBC.

To configure the metamodel generator simply add the following dependency to the annotation processor classpath:

dependency:hibernate-jpamodelgen[groupId="org.hibernate.orm", scope="annotationProcessor"]

NOTE: The Hibernate 6 version of `hibernate-jpamodelgen-jakarta` is required because prior versions of Hibernate are still using the `javax.persistence` package.
For Kotlin, add the dependency in https://docs.micronaut.io/4.4.3/guide/#kaptOrKsp[kapt or ksp scope], and for Groovy add it in compileOnly scope.

And we need to include the generated classes on the Java classpath to have them accessible:

Example for Gradle builds:

[source,groovy]
----
sourceSets {
    generated {
        java {
            srcDirs = ["$build/generated/java"]
        }
    }
}
----

If everything is correctly set up you should be able to see the generated metamodel classes in the IDE code completion and be able to use them:

snippet::example.PersonRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example",source="main" tags="typesafe",indent="0"]

---

snippet::example.ProductRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example",source="main" tags="typesafe",indent="0"]

NOTE: More information about the static metamodel can be found in the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.0/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.0.html#a6933[official specification]
