Micronaut Data JDBC / R2DBC supports most common Java data types. The following properties types are supported by default:

* All primitive types and their wrappers (`int`, `java.lang.Integer` etc.)
* `CharSequence`, `String` etc.
* Date types like `java.util.Date`, `java.time.LocalDate` etc.
* Enum types (by name only)
* Entity References. In the case of `@ManyToOne` the foreign key column name is computed to be the name of the association plus a suffix of `_id`. You can alter this with either `@Column(name="..")` or by providing a `NamingStrategy.mappedName(..)` implementation.
* Collections of Entity. In the case of `@OneToMany` and if `mappedBy` is specified then it is expected that the inverse property exists defining the column, otherwise a join table mapping is created.

If you wish to define a custom data type then you can do so by defining a class that is annotated with ann:data.annotation.TypeDef[].
