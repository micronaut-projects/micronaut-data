Inspired by the similar annotation in Hibernate, you can apply a transformation when either reading or writing a column from or to the database using the ann:data.jdbc.annotation.ColumnTransformer[] annotation.

This feature can be used to encrypt/decrypt values or invoke any arbitrary database function. To define a read transformation use the `read` member. For example:

.Applying a read transformation
[source,java]
----
@ColumnTransformer(read = "UPPER(@.name)")
private String name;
----

NOTE: `@` is a query alias placeholder and will be replaced with one if the query specifies it. Example: `"UPPER(@.name)` is going to become `UPPER(project_.name).`

To apply a write transformation you should use the `write` member and include exactly one `?` placeholder:

.Apply a write transformation
[source,java]
----
@ColumnTransformer(write = "UPPER(?)")
private String name;
----

With this any place any `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement generated will include the above `write` entry.
