If there is a need to return column name in the result set as custom name, there is `alias` property in the ann:data.annotation.MappedProperty[] annotation.

It can be useful, for example, in legacy columns that might be too long for the query result (when combined with table aliases can exceed max column length).

snippet::example.Person[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

In this example, original column name `long_name_column_legacy_system` will be returned in a result from the database as `long_name`.
When `alias` property is set then be careful when writing custom or native queries to return field as indicated in `alias` value.

Setting `alias` in MappedProperty on assocations does not have an effect as it makes sense only on fields/columns mappings.
