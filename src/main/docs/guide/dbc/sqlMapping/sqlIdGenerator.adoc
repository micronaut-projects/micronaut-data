The default ID generation expects the database to populate a value for the ID such as an `IDENTITY` column.

You can remove the `@GeneratedValue` annotation and in this case the expectation is that you will assign an ID before calling `save()`.

If you wish to use sequences for the ID you should invoke the SQL that generates the sequence value and assign it prior to calling `save()`.

Automatically assigned UUIDs are also supported by adding a property annotated with `@Id` and `@AutoPopulated`.
