You can declare a field of a class as a JSON type using the ann:data.annotation.TypeDef[] annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
@TypeDef(type = DataType.JSON)
private Map<String, String> data;
----

The above will map to a column called `data`. Depending on the underling database the column type will be adjusted. For example for Postgres which features native JSON support the column type will be `JSONB`.

NOTE: To allow JSON to be serialized and deserialized in entity properties you must have Jackson and the `micronaut-runtime` module your classpath.
