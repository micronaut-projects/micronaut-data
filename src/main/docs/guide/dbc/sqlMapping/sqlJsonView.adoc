Since Micronaut Data 4.0 and Oracle23c database, an entity can be mapped to an JSON VIEW as follows:

[source,java]
----
@JsonView("CONTACT_VIEW")
public class ContactView
----

where "CONTACT_VIEW" is actual name of duality json view object in the database. It is currently supported only by the Oracle database, since version 23c.
More about Oracle JSON VIEW can be read here https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jsnvu/overview-json-relational-duality-views.html.

Essentially, json view will be treated like mapped entity and will return JSON structure from the database and be mapped to java entity. All CRUD operations can be
performed against json view mapped entities.

Limitations

* During schema creation, json view mapped entities are skipped, and it is expected for users to create them manually or via migration scripts.
