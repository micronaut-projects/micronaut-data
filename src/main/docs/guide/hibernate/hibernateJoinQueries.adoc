To optimize your queries you may need to alter joins to fetch exactly the data you need in the result set.

TIP: If a `LazyInitializationException` occurs this is not a bug in Micronaut Data or Hibernate, but instead an indication that you should alter your query joins to fetch the associated data you need to implement your use case.

Consider a `Product` entity:

snippet::example.Product[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="entity"]

That has an association to a `Manufacturer` entity:

snippet::example.Manufacturer[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main"]

In this case when you read each `Product` from the database an additional select is required to retrieve the `Manufacturer` for each `Product`. This leads to `N + 1` queries.

To resolve this you can use the ann:data.annotation.Join[] annotation on your repository interface to specify that a `JOIN FETCH` should be executed to retrieve the associated `Manufacturer`.

snippet::example.ProductRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main",tags="join"]


<1> The ann:data.annotation.Join[] is used to indicate a `JOIN FETCH` clause should be included.

Note that the ann:data.annotation.Join[] annotation is repeatable and hence can be specified multiple times for different associations. In addition, the `type` member of the annotation can be used to specify the join type, for example `LEFT`, `INNER` or `RIGHT`.

=== JPA 2.1 Entity Graphs

A JPA-specific alternative to specifying the joins to a query is to use JPA 2.1 entity graphs. With entity graphs you defer to the JPA implementation to pick the appropriate join type to use:

snippet::example.ProductRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main",tags="entitygraph", indent="0"]

<1> The `attributePaths` member is used to specify the paths to include in the Entity graph.
