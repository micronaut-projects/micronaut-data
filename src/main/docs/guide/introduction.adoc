Micronaut Data is a database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer.

Micronaut Data is inspired by https://gorm.grails.org[GORM] and https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data], however improves on those solutions in the following ways:

* *No runtime model* - Both GORM and Spring Data maintain a runtime meta-model that uses reflection to model relationships between entities. This model consumes significant memory and memory requirements grow as your application size grows. The problem is worse when combined with Hibernate which maintains its own meta-model as you end up with duplicate meta-models.
* *No query translation* - Both GORM and Spring Data use regular expressions and pattern matching in combination with runtime generated proxies to translate a method definition on a Java interface into a query at runtime. No such runtime translation exists in Micronaut Data and this work is carried out by the Micronaut compiler at compilation time.
* *No Reflection or Runtime Proxies* - Micronaut Data uses no reflection or runtime proxies, resulting in better performance, smaller stack traces and reduced memory consumption due to a complete lack of reflection caches (Note that the backing implementation, for example Hibernate, may use reflection).
* *Type Safety* - Micronaut Data will actively check at compile time that a repository method can be implemented and fail compilation if it cannot.

Micronaut Data provides a general API for translating a compile time Query model into a query at compilation time and provides runtime support for the following backends:

* <<hibernate, JPA (Hibernate)>> and <<hibernateReactive, Hibernate Reactive>>
* <<sql, SQL (JDBC, R2DBC)>>
* <<mongo, MongoDB>>

Further implementations for other databases are planned in the future.

The following sections will take you through the basics of querying and using Micronaut Data, if you wish to understand more detail about how Micronaut Data works check out the <<howItWorks, How Micronaut Data Works>> section.

At a fundamental level however what Micronaut Data does can be summed up in the following snippets. Given the following interface:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="repository"]

<1> The `@Repository` annotation designates `BookRepository` as a data repository. Since, it is is an interface, the `@Repository` annotation provides implementations at compilation time.
<2> By extending api:data.repository.CrudRepository[] you enable automatic generation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Micronaut Data computes the query for the `find` method automatically at compilation time making it available at runtime via annotation metadata:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", tags="metadata", indent="0"]

<1> The https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/inject/BeanDefinition.html[BeanDefinition] is retrieved from the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/BeanContext.html[BeanContext]
<2> The `find` method is retrieved
<3> The value of the ann:data.annotation.Query[] annotation is retrieved
<4> The JPA-QL query for the method is correct
