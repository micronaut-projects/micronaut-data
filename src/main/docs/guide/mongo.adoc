Micronaut Data MongoDB supports most of the things that are possible to do with JPA and JDBC/R2DBC implementations, including:

- <<mongoRepositories, Repositories with compile-time generated filtering, aggregation>> and <<projections, projection>> queries
- <<mongoAssociationMapping, Entities relations and cascading>>
- <<transactions, Transactions>>
- <<mongoJoinQueries, Joining relations>>
- <<mongoCriteriaSpecifications, JPA Criteria API>>
- <<mongoAttributeConverter, Attribute converters>>
- <<mongoOptimisticLocking, Optimistic locking>>

In the first version of Micronaut Data MongoDB only synchronous MongoDB driver is supported.

The interaction between the object layer and MongoDB's driver serialization/deserialization is implemented using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-serialization/1.0.x/guide[Micronaut Serialization] and BSON support.
