As mentioned in the <<mongoQuickStart, Quick Start>> section, if you need to customize how entities map to the collection and attribute names of the collection you need use Micronaut Data's own annotations in the `io.micronaut.data.annotation` package.

An important aspect of Micronaut Data MongoDB is that the entity classes must be compiled with Micronaut Data. This is because Micronaut Data pre-computes the persistence model (the relationships between entities, the class/property name to collection/attribute name mappings) at compilation time, which is one of the reasons Micronaut Data MongoDB can startup so fast.

An example of mapping with Micronaut Data annotations can be seen below:

.Micronaut Data Annotation Mapping Example
snippet::example.Country[project-base="doc-examples/mongo-example", source="main", tags="country"]

<1> The class is marked as a mapped entity that should be persisted in the `country` collection
<2> The id is defined as MongoDB's `ObjectId`
<3> The `regions` are stored in a separate collection represented by `CountryRegion`
<4> The `name` field that should be persisted in a collection
