Micronaut Data supports reflection-free Data Transfer Object (DTO) projections if the return type is annotated with `@Introspected`.

For example if you wanted to project on an entity called `Book` you could define a DTO as follows:

snippet::example.BookDTO[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", indent="0"]

The DTO should include properties that match the property names you wish to project on (in this case `title` and `pages`). If any properties do not match then a compilation error will occur.

You can then use the DTO object as return type in query methods:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="dto", indent="0"]

Micronaut Data will optimize the query to only select the necessary properties from the database.

NOTE: You can use ann:data.annotation.NamingStrategy[] annotation to override the default naming strategy.
