Micronaut Data R2DBC is an implementation that pre-computes native SQL queries (given a particular database dialect) and provides a repository implementation that is a simple data mapper between a native result set and an an entity that works reactively by building ontop of the https://r2dbc.io[R2DBC specification].

The R2DBC implementation is fully reactive and bring some differences compared to JPA or Micronaut Data JDBC.

Micronaut Data R2DBC supports all of the features of Micronaut Data JDBC including <<criteria, dynamic finders>>, <<pagination,pagination>>, <<projections,projections>>, <<dto,Data Transfer Objects (DTO)>>, <<dataUpdates, Batch Updates>>, <<optimisticLocking, Optimistic locking>> and so on.

Like Micronaut Data JDBC, Micronaut Data R2DBC is not a Object Relational Mapping (ORM) implementation and does not and will not include any of the following concepts:

* Lazy Loading or Proxying of Associations
* Dirty Checking
* Persistence Contexts / Sessions
* First Level Caching and Entity Proxies

Micronaut Data R2DBC is designed for users who prefer a lower-level experience and working directly with SQL and wish to build non-blocking, reactive applications.
