To insert data the simplest form is to define a method that accepts the type of the entity, the same way as the api:data.repository.CrudRepository[] interface does:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="save", indent="0"]

The method must accept a single argument that is the entity and start with either `save`, `persist`, `insert` or `store`, to persist multiple entities the method needs to accept `java.lag.Iterable` of the entity.

Alternatively you can also define a method that features parameter names that match the properties of the entity name:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="save2", indent="0"]

In this case, when update of whole entity is intended, you must specify parameters for all properties other than those that are declared as `@Nullable` or as a `@GeneratedValue`, if you do not a compilation error will occur.

The insert method can have a custom query defined by ann:data.annotation.Query[] annotation:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="inserts", indent="0"]

TIP: It is not possible to use the entity as the return type in partial updates because it would require an additional select to retrieve the additional information. A number type (int, long, etc) can be returned to indicate the number of rows updated. The updated row count should be checked in most scenarios to ensure the update actually affected the row.
