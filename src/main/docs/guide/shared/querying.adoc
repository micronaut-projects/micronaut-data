The implementation of querying in Micronaut Data is based on the dynamic finders in https://gorm.grails.org[GORM].

A pattern matching approach is taken at compilation time. The general pattern of query methods is:

.Query Method Pattern
image::finderpattern.svg[]

As shown in Figure 1, the most common query stem is `find`, but you can also use `search`, `query`, `get`, `read` or `retrieve`.

The projection and ordering parts of the query pattern are optional (more on those later). The following snippet demonstrates 3 simple queries that use a different stem but perform the same query:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="simple", indent="0"]

The above examples return a single instance of an entity, the supported return types are described in the following table:

.Supported Return Types for Finder Methods
[cols=2*]
|===
|*Return Type*
|*Description*

|`List<Book>`
|A `java.util.List` or any common `Iterable` type

|`Stream<Book>`
|A Java 8 `java.util.stream.Stream` instance

|`Optional<Book>`
|An optional value, if `null` is retrieved otherwise a api:data.exceptions.EmptyResultException[] is thrown

|`Page<Book>`
|An instance of api:data.model.Page[] for pagination.

|`Slice<Book>`
|An instance of api:data.model.Slice[] for pagination.

|`Future<Book>` or `CompletableFuture<Book>`
|A `java.util.concurrent.Future` for asynchronous execution

|`Publisher<Book>` (or 'Flowable', `Single`, `Maybe`, `Flux`, `Mono` etc.)
|An Reactive Streams compatible type

|`Flow<Book>` as an alternative to `suspend` functions
|A Kotlin reactive type. Requires `kotlinx-coroutines-reactive` dependency for the proper conversion.

|Primitive/Simple Types
|In the case of projections primitive/basic types can be returned
|===

NOTE: Methods with `Stream<Book>` results need to be used with a 'try-with-resources' block and should be executed within a transaction.

In addition, to the standard `findBy*` pattern, a few other patterns exist that have special return type requirements.

The following table summarizes the possible alternative patterns, behaviour and expected return types:

.Method Patterns and Return Types
[cols=3*]
|===
|*Method Pattern*
|*Expected Return Type*
|*Description*

|`countBy*`
|A primitive number of an instance of `java.lang.Number`
|Counts the number of records

|`existsBy*`
|A primitive or wrapper `boolean`
|Checks whether a record exists

|`deleteBy*`
|A `void` or `Number` return type
|Batch delete for the given finder

|`updateBy*`
|A `void` or `Number` return type
|Batch update for the given finder

|===

TIP: More details about the batch update variants of these methods is covered in the <<dataUpdates, Data Updates>> section.

Finally, as an alternative to the `By` syntax you also define simple finders that use the parameter names to match properties to query. This syntax is less flexible, but is more readable in certain circumstances. For example the following can be used as an alternative to `findByTitle`:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="simple-alt", indent="0"]

Note that in this case if the `title` parameter does not exist as a property in the entity being queried or the type does not match up a compilation error will occur. Also you can specify more than one parameter to perform a logical `AND`.
