Micronaut Data supports asynchronous query execution by defining methods that return either `CompletionStage`, `CompletableFuture` or `Future`.

In the case of asynchronous execution and if the backing implementation is blocking, Micronaut Data will use the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#reactiveServer[Configured I/O thread pool] to schedule the query execution on a different thread.

The following is an example of a couple of asynchronous methods:

snippet::example.ProductRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main",tags="async"]

The above example defines two methods that use `CompletableFuture` as return type, the API for which you can use to compose query operations:

snippet::example.ProductRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example"tags="async", indent="0"]

NOTE: In the case of JPA each operation will run with its own transaction and session, hence care needs to be taken to fetch the correct data and avoid detached objects. In addition, for more complex operations it may be more efficient to write custom code that uses a single session.
