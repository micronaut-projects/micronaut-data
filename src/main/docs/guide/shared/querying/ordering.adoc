You can control ordering of results by appending an `OrderBy*` expression to the end of the method name:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="ordering", indent="0"]

The `OrderBy*` expression refer to the property name to order by and can optionally be appended with either `Asc` or `Desc` to control ascending or descending order. Multiple conditions can be used by joining them with `And` like `findByTypeOrderByNameAndDate`.
