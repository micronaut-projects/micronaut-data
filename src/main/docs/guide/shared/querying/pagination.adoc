Typically when returning multiple records you need some control over paging the data. Micronaut Data includes the ability to specify pagination requirements with the api:data.model.Pageable[] type (inspired by GORM's https://gorm.grails.org/latest/api/grails/orm/PagedResultList.html[PagedResultList] and Spring Data's https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/domain/Pageable.html[Pageable]).

In addition methods can return a api:data.model.Page[] object which includes the execution of an additional query to obtain the total number of results for a given query.

The following are some example signatures:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="pageable", indent="0"]

And some test data:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example"tags="saveall", indent="0"]

You can execute queries and return paginated data using the `from` method of api:data.model.Pageable[] and specifying an appropriate return type:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example"tags="pageable", indent="0"]

The `from` method accepts `index` and `size` arguments which are the page number to begin from and the number of records to return per page.

A api:data.model.Slice[] is the same as a api:data.model.Page[] but results in one less query as it excludes the total number of pages calculation.
