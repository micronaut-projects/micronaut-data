Frequently, rather than retrieving all of the data for a particular entity, you may only want a single property or association of an entity or to perform some kind of computation and obtain just that result. This is where query projections come in.

The simplest form of projection is to retrieve a property or association. For example:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="simple-projection", indent="0"]

In the above example the `findTitleByPagesGreaterThan` method is resolving the `title` property of the `Book` entity and returning the data as a `List` of `String`.

NOTE: If the projected property type and the return generic type do not match up then Micronaut Data will fail to compile the method.

You can also use projections on association paths, for example if an `author` association were present you could write `findAuthorNameByPagesGreaterThan` to retrieve the names of all the authors.

In addition to this, Micronaut Data also supports projection expressions. The following table summarizes the possible expressions with an example and description:

.Projection Expressions
[cols=3*]
|===
|*Expression*
|*Example*
|*Description*

|`Count`
|`countTitleByPagesGreaterThan`
|Counts the values

|`CountDistinct`
|`countDistinctTitleByPagesGreaterThan`
|Counts the distinct values

|`Distinct`
|`findDistinctTitleByPagesGreaterThan`
|Finds the distinct property values

|`Max`
|`findMaxPagesByTitleLike`
|Finds the maximum property value

|`Min`
|`findMinPagesByTitleLike`
|Finds the minimum property value

|`Sum`
|`findSumPagesByTitleLike`
|Finds the sum of all the property values

|`Avg`
|`findAvgPagesByTitleLike`
|Finds the average of all the property values

|===

You can also use `top` or `first` to limit the results returned (as a simple alternative to pagination)

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", tags="top-projection", indent="0"]

The above query will return the first 3 results for the given query expression.
