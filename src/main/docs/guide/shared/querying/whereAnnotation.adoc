You can use the ann:data.annotation.Where[] annotation to modify compile time generated query with additional query criterion.

A common use case for this is to implement soft delete. For example considering the following `User` entity which declares an `enabled` property:

snippet::example.User[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

<1> The ann:data.annotation.Where[] annotation is used to declare that all queries should include `enabled = true` and `@` is a placeholder for the query's alias.
<2> An `enabled` property exists on the entity

You can then easily modify the `delete` operations to instead issue an update. For example, consider the following repository implementation:

snippet::example.UserRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

<1> The interface extends api:data.repository.CrudRepository[]
<2> The `deleteById` is overridden to perform a soft delete by setting `enabled` to false.
<3> An additional method is added to return disabled entities if needed using an explicit query.

All other queries performed on the entity will include `enabled = true` in the query statement.

It is also possible to override an entities ann:data.annotation.Where[] annotation by annotating a repository method with it.
The `findDisabled` example would then be:

snippet::example.UserRepositoryWithWhere[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

If you want to remove a ann:data.annotation.Where[] criteria from a particular repository method, you can use ann:data.annotation.IgnoreWhere[].
