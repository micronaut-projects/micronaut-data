Micronaut Data will automatically manage transactions for you. You can simply declare a method as transactional with the `jakarta.transaction.Transactional` annotation.

Micronaut Data maps the declared transaction annotation to the correct underlying semantics and compilation time.

NOTE: Starting Micronaut Data 4 repositories are no longer executed using a new transaction and will create a new connection if none is present.

TIP: If you prefer Spring-managed transactions for Hibernate or JDBC you can add the `micronaut-data-spring` dependency and Spring-managed transactions will be used instead. See the section on <<spring, Spring Support>> for more information.
