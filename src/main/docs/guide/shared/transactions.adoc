Micronaut Data will automatically manage transactions for you. You can simply declare a method as transactional with the `javax.transaction.Transactional` annotation.

TIP: If you prefer Spring-managed transactions for Hibernate or JDBC you can add the `micronaut-data-spring` dependency and Spring-managed transactions will be used instead. See the section on <<spring, Spring Support>> for more information.

Micronaut Data maps the declared transaction annotation to the correct underlying semantics and compilation time.

Micronaut Data will also automatically apply read-only transactional semantics to query methods and write transaction semantics to write operations.
