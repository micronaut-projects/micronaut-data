You can use the api:transaction.SynchronousTransactionManager[] API to perform programmatic transactions.

The following demonstrates an example:

snippet::example.ProductManager[project-base="doc-examples/hibernate-example", source="main", indent="0"]

<1> The constructor is injected with the api:transaction.SynchronousTransactionManager[] and a transaction-aware `EntityManager`
<2> The `save` method uses the `executeWrite` method to execute a write transaction within the context of the passed lambda.
<3> The `find` method uses the `executeRead` method to execute a read-only transaction within the context of the passed lambda.

Note that if you are using Micronaut Data JDBC then instead of an `EntityManager` you should inject a transaction-aware JDBC `Connection` object.

The following presents an example:

snippet::example.ProductManager[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main", indent="0"]

<1> The constructor is injected with the api:transaction.SynchronousTransactionManager[] and a transaction-aware `Connection`
<2> The `save` method uses the `executeWrite` method to execute a write transaction within the context of the passed lambda.
<3> The `find` method uses the `executeRead` method to execute a read-only transaction within the context of the passed lambda.

Note that it is important that you always use the injected connection as Micronaut Data makes available a transaction-aware implementation that uses the connection associated with the underlying transaction.

If a transaction is not active when using this connection then a api:transaction.exceptions.NoTransactionException[] will be thrown indicating you should either provide a programmatic transaction or use `@Transactional`.
