To get started with Micronaut Data JDBC add the following dependency to your annotation processor path:

dependency:io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor[scope="annotationProcessor", version="{version}"]

NOTE: For Kotlin the dependency should be in the `kapt` scope and for Groovy it should be in `compileOnly` scope.

You should then configure a compile scoped dependency on the `micronaut-data-jdbc` module:

dependency:io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-jdbc[version="{version}"]

You should also ensure you have the JDBC driver and connection pool dependencies configured. For example for H2 in-memory database driver:

dependency:com.h2database:h2[scope="runtime"]

And Hikari connection pool:

dependency:io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-jdbc-hikari[scope="runtime"]

Next up you need to configure at least one data source. The following snippet from `application.yml` is an example of configuring the default JDBC data source:

.Example YAML configuration
[source,yaml]
----
include::doc-examples/jdbc-example-java/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

NOTE: The `schema-generate` setting is only useful for demos and testing trivial examples, for production usage it is recommended you pair Micronaut Data with a SQL migration tool such as https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/index.html[Flyway] or https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-liquibase/latest/guide/index.html[Liquibase].

To retrieve objects from the database you need to define a class annotated with ann:data.annotation.MappedEntity[]. Note that this is a meta annotation and in fact if you prefer you can use JPA annotations (only a subset are supported, more on that later). If you wish to use JPA annotations include the following `compileOnly` scoped dependency:

dependency:jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api[version="3.0.0", scope="compileOnly"]

As above since only the annotations are used the dependency can be included only for compilation and not at runtime so you don't drag along the rest of the API, reducing your JAR file size.

You can then define an `@Entity`:

snippet::example.Book[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

Followed by an interface that extends from api:data.repository.CrudRepository[]

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main", tags="repository"]

<1> The interface is annotated with ann:data.jdbc.annotation.JdbcRepository[] and specifies a dialect of `H2` used to generate queries
<2> The `CrudRepository` interface take 2 generic arguments, the entity type (in this case `Book`) and the ID type (in this case `Long`)

You can now perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the entity. The implementation of `example.BookRepository` is created at compilation time. To obtain a reference to it simply inject the bean:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", tags="inject", indent="0"]

=== Saving an Instance (Create)

To save an instance use the `save` method of the `CrudRepository` interface:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", tags="save", indent="0"]

NOTE: Unlike the JPA implementation there is no dirty checking so `save` always performs a SQL `INSERT`. For batch updates use an `update` method (see following section).

=== Retrieving an Instance (Read)

To read a book back use `findById`:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", tags="read", indent="0"]

=== Updating an Instance (Update)

With Micronaut Data JDBC, you must manually implement an `update` method since the JDBC implementation doesn't include any dirty checking or persistence session notion. So you have to define explicit update methods for updates in your repository. For example:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main" tags="update", indent="0"]

Which can then be called like so:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", tags="update", indent="0"]

=== Deleting an Instance (Delete)

To delete an instance use `deleteById`:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/example", tags="delete", indent="0"]
