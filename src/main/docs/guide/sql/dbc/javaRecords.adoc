Since 2.3.0, Micronaut Data JDBC / R2DBC has support for using Java 16 records to model entities.

The following record class demonstrates this capability:

snippet::example.Book[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example-records", source="main"]

<1> The ann:data.annotation.MappedEntity[] annotation is used on the record
<2> The database identifier is annotated with ann:data.annotation.Id[] and ann:data.annotation.GeneratedValue[] plus marked as `@Nullable`

Since records are immutable constructor arguments that are generated values need to be marked as `@Nullable` and you should pass `null` for those arguments. The following presents an example:

snippet::example.BookRepositorySpec[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example-records", tags="save", indent="0"]

It is important to note that the returned instance is not the same as the instance passed to the `save` method. When a write operation is performed Micronaut Data will use a copy-constructor approach to populate the database identifier and return a new instance from the `save` method.
