Predator JDBC supports most common Java data types. The following properties types are supported by default:

* All primitive types and their wrappers (`int`, `java.lang.Integer` etc.)
* `CharSequence`, `String` etc.
* Date types like `java.util.Date`, `java.time.LocalDate` etc.
* Enum types (by name only)
* Entity References. In the case of `@ManyToOne` the foreign key column name is computed to be the name of the association plus a suffix of `_id`. You can alter this with either `@Column(name="..")` or by providing a `NamingStrategy.mappedName(..)` implementation.
* Collections of Entity. In the case of `@OneToMany` and if `mappedBy` is specified then it is expected that the inverse property exists defining the column, otherwise a join table mapping is created.

If you wish to define a custom data type then you can do so by defining a class that is annotated with ann:data.annotation.TypeDef[].

Consider the following example entity:

snippet::example.Sale[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

The `Sale` class has a reference to a type `Quantity`. The `Quantity` type is defined as:

snippet::example.Quantity[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

As you can see `@TypeDef` is used to define the `Quantity` type as an `INTEGER` using the api:data.model.DataType[] enum.

TIP: If you cannot declare `@TypeDef` directly on the type then you can declare it on the field where the type is used.

The last step is to add custom type conversion so that Predator knows how to read and write the type from an `Integer`:

snippet::example.QuantityConverters[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

<1> A `@Factory` bean is created to define the converters
<2> A converter from `Quantity` to `Integer`
<3> A converter from `Integer` to `Quantity`
