Unlike JPA/Hibernate, Micronaut Data JDBC is stateless and has no notion of a persistence session that requires state management.

Since there is no session, features like dirty checking are not supported. This has implications when defining repository methods for inserts and updates.

By default when saving an entity with a method like `save(MyEntity)` a SQL `INSERT` is always performed since Micronaut Data has no way to know whether the entity is associated to a particular session.

If you wish to update an entity you should instead either use `update(MyEntity)` or even better define an appropriate `update` method to update only the data you want to update, for example:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main" tags="update", indent="0"]

By being explicit in defining the method as an update method Micronaut Data knows to execute an `UPDATE`.
