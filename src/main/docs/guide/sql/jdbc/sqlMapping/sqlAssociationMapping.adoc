To specify a relation between two entities you need to use ann:data.annotation.Relation[] annotation. The relation kind is specified using enum ann:data.annotation.Relation.Kind[] `value` attribute which is similar to JPA relations annotation names (`@OneToMany`, `@OneToOne` etc.)

.Micronaut Data supported relations:
[cols=2*]
|===
|*Kind*
|*Description*

|`Kind.ONE_TO_MANY`
|One to many association

|`Kind.ONE_TO_ONE`
|One to one association

|`Kind.MANY_TO_MANY`
|Many to many association

|`Kind.MANY_TO_ONE`
|Many to one association

|`Kind.EMBEDDED`
|Embedded association
|===

Use 'mappedBy' to specify inverse property that this relation is mapped by.

.Micronaut Data supported association cascade types:
[cols=2*]
|===
|*Type*
|*Description*

|`Cascade.PERSIST`
|Associated entity or entities are going to be persisted when owning entity is saved

|`Cascade.UPDATE`
|Associated entity or entities are going to be updated when owning entity is updated

|`Cascade.NONE`
|(Default) No operation is cascaded

|`Cascade.ALL`
|All (`Cascade.PERSIST` and `Cascade.UPDATE`) operations are cascaded
|===


NOTE: You can use JPA's equivalent annotations ann:data.jdbc.annotation.JoinTable[] and ann:data.jdbc.annotation.JoinColumn[] to specify more complex mapping definition.
