To write queries with Micronaut Data R2DBC you can use all the same patterns as defined in the <<querying, Micronaut Data documentation on querying>>.

The method pattern is essentially:

.Query Method Pattern

The Reactive return type is used to figure out whether the query is for a single result or multiple. If you use for example rx:Single[] or Reactor's `Mono` type a single result will be returned, whilst a rx:Flowable[] or Reactor `Flux` will return multiple records.

You can pass a api:data.model.Pageable[] instance to any query to paginate results, although note that the api:data.model.Page[] return type is not supported since it is an implicitly blocking API.
