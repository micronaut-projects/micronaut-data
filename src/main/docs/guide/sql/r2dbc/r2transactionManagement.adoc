Micronaut Data R2DBC features Reactive transaction management support whereby you can declare `javax.transaction.Transactional` on your methods and a reactive transaction will be initiated, for example:

snippet::example.AuthorService[project-base="doc-examples/r2dbc-example", source="main", indent="0"]

<1> Supporting repositories are injected
<2> `@Transactional` is used to declare a transaction

This same declarative logic can be done programmatically as well by injecting the api:data.r2dbc.operations.R2dbcOperations[] interface:


snippet::example.BookControllerTest[project-base="doc-examples/r2dbc-example", source="test", indent="0", tags="programmatic-tx"]

In the above case the `withTransaction` method is used to initiate a transaction.

Note however, that transaction management is possibly one of the most challenging areas to get right in reactive programming since you need to propagate the transaction across the reactive flow.

Most R2DBC drivers are implemented in https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] which has the ability to https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#context[propagate a context] across reactive operators and Micronaut Data R2DBC will populate this context and ensure the transaction is re-used if it is found within it.

However, it is still pretty easy for the context to be lost since different libraries that implement Reactive Streams don't propagate contexts between each other so if you include RxJava or any other reactive operator library it is likely the context will be lost.

To ensure this doesn't happen it is recommended that you annotate write operations that participate within a transaction as `MANDATORY` which ensures it is not possible to run these methods without a surrounding transaction present so that if the transaction is somehow lost within the reactive flow it doesn't cause operations to be run in separate transactions:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/r2dbc-example", source="main", indent="0", tags="mandatory"]

If the transaction is somehow lost during the reactive flow there are a couple of ways you can solve the problem. One way is to use the `withTransaction` method of the api:data.r2dbc.operations.R2dbcOperations[] interface to obtain the current `ReactiveTransactionStatus`, you can then pass this instance into another execution of the `withTransaction` method or pass it directly as the last argument to any method declared on the repository itself.

An example of the former approach is presented below, using RxJava 2 this time which will cause propagation loss:

snippet::example.BookControllerTest[project-base="doc-examples/r2dbc-example", source="test", indent="0", tags="programmatic-tx-status"]

<1> An outer `withTransaction` call starts the transaction
<2> An inner call ensures the existing transaction is propagated
